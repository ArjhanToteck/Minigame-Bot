# Minigame Bot
This is a very simple Discord bot written in Discord.js. I wrote this a while ago, and rushed quite a bit while doing so, so it's pretty crappy. If you want to learn more about the bot (and/or invite it) [head here](https://arjhantoteck.vercel.app/minigame%20bot.html). I don't recommend it though, the bot isn't particularly great.

# 2021 Update
The bot somehow got added to enough servers to get verified. Notice the checkmark next to "BOT." Very cool.

Discord released some new stuff to their API such as buttons and slash commands, but I probably won't update this bot for a while. I've got better stuff to do.
